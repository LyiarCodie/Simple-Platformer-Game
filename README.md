# Simple Sword Game

🫠 This is my first game made with **GameMaker: Studio 2**

🚀 Currently, the player can:

- Jump
- Move
- Attack (player can combo attack)

🎹 Keyboard Inputs:

- A and D: move horizontally
- Space: jump
- J: Attack and pressing J again, you can make a combo.

🧐 This is also the project that i implemented my first states machine.

🎡 I used these free assets:

- [Fantasy Knight - Free Pixelart Animated Character](https://aamatniekss.itch.io/fantasy-knight-free-pixelart-animated-character)
