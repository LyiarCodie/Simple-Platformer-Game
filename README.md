# Simple Sword Game

🫠 This is my first game made with **GameMaker: Studio 2**

🚀 Currently, the player can:

- Jump
- Move
- Attack (just 1 attack type)

🧐 This is also the project that i implemented my first states machine.

🎡 I used these free assets:

- [Fantasy Knight - Free Pixelart Animated Character](https://aamatniekss.itch.io/fantasy-knight-free-pixelart-animated-character)
